With an aerospace engineering background, I apply Machine Learning solutions on complex problems on the aeronautical industry every day. I help my team collect, process and store data on Airbus Cloud platform Skywise. I also create dashboards with the latest data visualization tools such as Qlick or Spotfire. In general, I can say that I am a data enthusiast trying to perform at the best level every day.
